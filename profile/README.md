# Daniel-Development-4 (D&D)

Welcome to **Daniel-Development-4 (D&D)** — a collaborative GitHub organization formed by a group of friends who studied Systems and Computer Engineering at the **Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia (UPTC)**, Sogamoso campus. The name “D&D” originates from the initials of our founders, both named Daniel, and reflects our shared interest in software development and teamwork.

## About this Organization

This space was created with the intention of organizing and centralizing the software projects we developed during our academic journey, starting around 2019. It serves as an archive and presentation of our university work, maintaining the history and evolution of our collaborative efforts.

While the organization currently does not host active projects or accept external contributions, it showcases the teamwork and learning process of our group throughout our studies.
